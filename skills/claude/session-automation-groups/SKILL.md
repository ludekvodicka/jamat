description: "Set Jamat automation session groups consistently across workflows. Use when an automated worker starts, waits for a person or review, resumes, is blocked, finishes, or receives follow-up work. Jamat owns and installs this skill for Claude and Codex. Does not close sessions or manage worktrees."

# Session automation groups

Use this installed skill's `scripts/session-automation-groups.mjs` with Node. Jamat installs and
updates this adapter automatically. Read [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the CLI and failure rules.

The calling workflow owns task truth and decides when a transition is justified. This skill owns
the presentation. Never reproduce the mapping in a workflow or infer completion from process
activity, `idle`, a stopped process, a closed ticket alone, or a code commit alone.
Complete the caller's mandatory entry and session-ownership proof before any presentation call.

- Report `working` before task work, after an answer, and before any follow-up edits.
- Report `waiting` before asking a person or opening any human review. A cancelled review stays
  waiting. After approval report `working` if further work remains.
- Report `blocked` for a known obstacle that prevents progress; put its reason in the note.
- Report `completed` only after the whole task, all required reviews and final verification.
  A code landing followed by an outstanding trail/documentation review is still unfinished.

The worker applies its own transitions directly, even without a coordinator. Coordinators may
reconcile their current verified workflow state. A workflow must not repaint another pass's or
a person's unrelated session. Do not opt an interactive session into automation implicitly.

For own transitions use `apply --self --state STATE`. Keep the workflow's active color with
`--active-color COLOR` when resuming. An optional `--note-file PATH` replaces the entire note:
preserve ticket/worktree identification and give a concrete reason when waiting or blocked.
Omitting the note preserves it. Move no files, tickets, tabs or worktrees as part of this skill.

Do not ask permission for the presentation change itself. An unsuccessful result must be reported;
preserve the actual task result and pending work. Do not repeat a commit or create a replacement
session because presentation failed. Retrying this helper with the same current state is safe.
